## Build on OS X
If you're getting an error like `fatal error: 'openssl/ui.h' file not found`, it's coming from https://github.com/gcmurphy/getpass which uses cgo.
In order to build this correctly on OS X, You need to install OpenSSL using homebrew (`brew install openssl && brew link openssl --force`). Then you need to create a symlink to OpenSSL in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include`
